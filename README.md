### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nathan Casados and I am into using Elixir to build systems.

As of writing this (2021/12/22) I've been doing an Elixir backend for Skyline Solar.

This application is an Elixir Umbrella application using Phoenix Framework, Oban, and wrappers for eight Software as a Service applications APIs. The Elixir application handles realtime webhooks (where available) to pass information between the eight SaaS products.

In this way, Skyline Solar has been able to double their Sales since implementing in 2020. It has been a pretty wild ride.

I've become pretty good at using `Stream.resource/3` to pull everything out of a SaaS service and store it into my own Postgres with Ecto so I can easily query more deeply on our data from any of these SaaS products.
